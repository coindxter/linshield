## About The Project
LinShield is a comprehensive hardening script designed for CyberPatriots participants, aimed at improving the security of Ubuntu 22.04 and Debian 11 systems. This project helps users configure a virtual computer with a focus on competition needs, addressing vulnerabilities as they change over time.

**Note**: This project is constantly evolving, and contributions are encouraged to adapt to new vulnerabilities and challenges.

## Features
- Configures security settings based on CIS benchmarks
- Easy-to-modify scripts for last-minute competition adjustments
- AI! Uses Chatgpt 4o to create custom configs for scripts
- Modular scripts for tailored use (run individually if needed)

## Getting Started
Before using this project, **read any README files provided with the competition image**. These files may contain crucial information for modifying scripts to suit your specific needs, such as preserving critical services like SSH.

     ```

## Usage
Run each script as needed for specific hardening tasks. Refer to the provided README files or comments within each script for more details. **Do not execute the entire script as root.**

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

```
root
│
├── archive (Old or reference files)
│
├── util (Helper scripts)
│
├── deb (Debian-specific scripts)
│   └── src
│       └── scr (Main scripts)
│
└── ubu (Ubuntu-specific scripts)
    └── src
        └── scr (Main scripts)
```

Keep this file structure intact for better organization and clarity.
