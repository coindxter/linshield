# README Parser Script

This project includes a Python script (`readme_parser.py`) that processes a CyberPatriot README in HTML format, extracts structured data using OpenAI's GPT-4, and outputs it as a JSON file.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. **Dependencies**: Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install openai beautifulsoup4 jsonschema python-dotenv
Setting Up Your OpenAI API Key
To run this script, you need to set up your OPENAI_API_KEY in your environment.

Option 1: Set Environment Variable Directly
For Linux/Mac:
Open your terminal.
Run the following command to set the API key temporarily:
bash
Copy code
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_secure_api_key"
To set it permanently, add the line to your shell configuration file (~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, or ~/.zshrc):
bash
Copy code
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_secure_api_key"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
For Windows:
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
Run the following command to set the API key temporarily:
cmd
Copy code
set OPENAI_API_KEY="your_secure_api_key"
To set it permanently:
Go to Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced system settings.
Click Environment Variables.
Under User variables or System variables, click New and add:
Variable name: OPENAI_API_KEY
Variable value: your_secure_api_key
Click OK and restart your Command Prompt or computer.
Option 2: Use a .env File
Create a .env file in the root directory of your project with the following content:

ini
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_secure_api_key
Modify your script to load the .env file:

python
Copy code
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
import openai

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    raise EnvironmentError("OPENAI_API_KEY not set in environment. Please set it in the .env file.")

openai.api_key = api_key
Running the Script
Once the API key is set up, run the script with the following command:

bash
Copy code
python /path/to/readme_parser.py
Replace /path/to/ with the directory path where your readme_parser.py is located.

Example Usage
Make sure your input HTML README file is ready.
Run the script with the appropriate paths:
bash
Copy code
python /Users/your_username/path/to/readme_parser.py
The script will process the HTML README, extract the data using OpenAI, and save the output as ReadMe.json in the specified directory.

Troubleshooting
API Key Error: If you receive an error about OPENAI_API_KEY not being set, double-check that the environment variable is correctly configured and accessible to your script.
Dependencies Missing: Ensure all required libraries are installed by running:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Create a requirements.txt file with the dependencies if needed.)

### Steps in Summary:
1. Add instructions for setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in environment variables or using a `.env` file.
2. Provide clear commands for setting up and running the script.
3. Include troubleshooting tips for common issues (e.g., missing API key or dependencies).
4. Ensure the README is clear and easy to follow for users unfamiliar with environment variable setup.

This guide ensures that users can set up their environment and run your script without issu
